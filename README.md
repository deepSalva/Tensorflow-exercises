This exercises are conceive for implement machine learning models in Tensorflow

First exercise I implement a linear regression with Tensorflow. I will use the data from the first project in Udacity Deep Learning Fundation Nanodegree, bike_sharing repository

Second is an example of logistic regression with Tensorflow. You can find all the data set information in the file info.txt in the same repository
